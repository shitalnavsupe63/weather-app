# weather-app

Developed a dynamic Weather App using Flask, integrating a third-party weather API to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for weather conditions by city, displaying essential data such as temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions.
